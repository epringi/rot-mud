area: where all the areas are defined.  Areas contain information for mobs (NPCs, like shopkeepers etc), objects, and rooms.
player: all players are recorded here
gods: players that are gods have files in here with god information inside: level, trust (security level), and title.

area2 was me fixing linking between rooms in different areas, not sure if it's needed anymore so I'll just keep it around for now.

The makefile in src/ is already ready to go on linux, so you don't have to do anything (I had to actually tweak it a bit to get it working since the code is so damn old)

To shut the game down either kill the process or log in as an immortal and issue the 'shutdown' command.

The area/ and src/ dirs are in separate repos to make things less complicated.  I thought about using git submodule but that sounded like a pain in the ass. :P
area: https://github.com/epringi/rot-area.git
src: https://github.com/epringi/rot-src.git

Things on my mind for the game:
   Get the reboot function working.
   Get the copyover function working; this allows updating of areas and such without rebooting the game, so players don't get booted.
   Maybe make the startup script in bin/ work?
   Make the in-game room / area editing less awkward.
   Revamp the Mud School area (the training area for new players)


Anyway, read the README in doc/, log in and poke around.

Cheers!
